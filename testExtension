//we want to see which branch commit will prevail, likely this one.
//i called this branch "sam fix e120" as if it were a real tealium request.
//local branches CAN see github branches- if the local repository was the one that initialized the branch.
//this test is to see if i can pull commits from github
//it worked! this new test is to see if I can push commits to GitHub from my laptop
//now to see if this will go into tealium directly
//if so, this may conclude our testing 
//TEST COMPLETE
